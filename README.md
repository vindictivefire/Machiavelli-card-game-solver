# Machiavelli-card-game-solver
I've coded an algorithm in C++ to solve the game of Machiavelli. The problem is simple: Given some cards, find a way to put down every card in your hand in either a straight or a triple. There can be multiple decks. This solver can solve 100 cards in times ranging from 0 seconds to 5 seconds.  This is my first project, I appreciate any feedback!


How to use: open machiavelli.exe, type in all the cards (like H10) with spaces inbetween, then type done.
